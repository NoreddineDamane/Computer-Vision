# Leaf_clustering

The objective of this tutorial is to build a tree leaf image clustering program using the features extracted by a pre-trained VGG16. This program could be used on other datasets.

The dataset consists of approximately 1,584 leaf specimen images (16 samples of each of the 99 species) that have been converted to binary black leaves on a white background.
